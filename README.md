# Finance_PortfolioOptimization
This project is submitted as the final project of the course Financial Analytics under Data Analytics for Business program at St. Clair College, Windsor, Ontario. As the name suggests, a financial portfolio is created and optimized in this project using manual weight-assignment approach and Monte Carlo Simulation.
In this project, an attempt has been made to create a diversified portfolio with 10 different stocks that belong to different domains and have minimal co-dependence on each other. Once the stocks in the portfolio are finalized, an attempt has been made to optimize the portfolio to give maximum return with less susceptibility to risk.
